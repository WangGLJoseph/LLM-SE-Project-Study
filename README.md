This repository contains all artifacts including AI-generated code, 
prompts used by the students, and survey results from the study.

## Usage

Ensure that you have renamed the paths and names of the repositories 
in the ms3_clone.sh and ms3_extract.sh scripts to match the names of the actual repos.

Run the ms3_clone.sh script to clone the repositories of the students. 
```bash
./ ms3_clone.sh
```

Run the ms3_extract.sh script to extract the tagged code from the repositories of the students. 
```bash
./ ms3_extract.sh
```
